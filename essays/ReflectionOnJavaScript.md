This is my first time experiencing javascript and so far its going pretty good. Going through the free code camp javascript tutorial was really helpful and I was able to learn a lot of the basics from that. Javascript also has a lot of similarities to java and C so I was familiar with a lot of the syntax. I did have to get used to certain things that were different from java but the tutorial and screencasts helped with that. It seems a bit more simple than java which I like. I think that it will be a good coding language for software development especially if there are a lot of free available source codes to rely on.
  
When I heard about the athletic software engineering and the practice WODs I was pretty intimidated but after taking my first WOD, I think that they will definitely be doable. The practice WODs that we've been doing have really helped to prepare me for the real one and so far I like the format of this class. As long as the practice WODs contiue to include concepts that will be on the real WODs, they will be very beneficial to everyone. Although the WODs place a lot of pressure on all the students because they are all or nothing, they will force us to be more efficient and productive. I'm sure that in a real work environment, people who have careers in the computer science field are working under time limits everyday. This will help us to be ready for our future careers. Overall, the WODs are very stressful but I think I need to be placed under pressure so that I can improve.
