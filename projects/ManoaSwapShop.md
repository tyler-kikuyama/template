Goal: The vision for our Manoa Swap Shop project was to create a safe and streamlined application where University of Hawaii students and faculty could safely buy and sell goods. Some of the key features that we aimed to implement were a user profile system, item listings page, add item page, and a way to show that an item has been purchased. Some additional features that we wanted to implement included a search bar for items, a way to sort items by cateogries, and a more accessible user data base system.

Overview: Our completed version of the Manoa Swap Shop did include the key features that we knew were essential to creating a successful application. When a user first creates an account, they will be led directly to a user profile creation page where they are required to input information that will be displayed on their user profile page. If a user wishes to edit their profile, there is an edit button on the profile page. Items to be sold can be added by going to the List an Item page. Information about the product such as the name, price, condition, category, image, and meeting location are all required to place a listing. Meeting places can only be selected by using a dropdown that lists locations at the UH Manoa campus to ensure that exchanging goods are as safe and comfortable as possible. Buying an item can be accomplished by messaging a seller through their provided email address. An item listings page exists where users are able to view all of the listed items. Each item has a clickable link that takes you to an item card page with all the specific information. The image of the item and owner are provided on this page. A item deletion button is available for a user to delete any item off their profile that they see fit. A user can view all of their listed items on their profile page.
