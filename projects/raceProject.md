summary: A simple racing game that I developed in my ICS 111 class.
---

  I created this project in my ICS 111 class where we were required to create a racing game. My professor and TA gave assistance whenever I ran into trouble and my professor had us use an EZ.java file that allowed us to create the visuals of our game through simple function calls.
  The objective of the game is to beat cpu opponents in a race from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen. I used a random generator to set the speed of the cpu opponents and the user had to press the 'A' and 'S' keys alternatively to move their racer. I added sound effects to each character that played whenever they took the lead in the race and each character was also given a sound effect if they finished the race first. Figuring out how to implement the user controls for the racer was tricky but I managed to figure it out with some help.
  This project took me around two weeks to complete and it taught me a lot about the basics of java. It was good to have a project that was a visual game because it made it easier to see how my code was translating into actual visible actions. It was a lot of fun working on a game for the first time and I look forward to more projects similar to this one.
