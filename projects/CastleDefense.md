summary: A castle defense game I developed in ICS 111.
---

  The objective of this game is to protect your castle by stopping enemies from reaching it using a laser that your character can shoot. The enemies also can shoot lasers and if you get hit by one you lose. I used some of the code from a game that our professor made an recycled it to use for the movement of the enemies and the main character. That recycled code also helped in creating hitboxes for the characters when they got hit by a laser.
  I worked with a partner for this project and also got a lot of help from my TA. My partner worked on developing the class for the villains and I worked on the main hero class. The main problem I ran into during this prject was how to implement the laser. When working on the laser method, the laser wouldn't always register when it hit an enemy so after working with my TA and a lot of hours spent trying to fix it, I managed to get it to work successfully. 
   In the end, the game ended up coming out pretty good. I worked well with my partner and we were able to successfully combine the two classes that we had been working on to create the game. This project helped me to develop teamwork and communication skills that will be really helpful in the future.
